Project Description
***************************
In this project, we implemented four different barriers in C++, two of which 
were implemented in OpenMP to synchronize between threads on the same node, 
and the other two were implemented using the MPI library to synchronize between 
MPI processes running on different nodes. After verifying the functionality of 
each barrier, we combined an OpenMP barrier and an MPI barrier to develop a 
combined barrier to synchronize all the threads across MPI processes and threads
on multiple nodes.

Instructions to Compile & Run
*******************************

For each barrier, please follow the procedure outlined below:

1. Unzip the submitted zip file
2. Navigate to ~/DivyaKiran_Kadiyala_p2/<barrier_name>
3. "make <barrier_name>" to compile the barrier code.

		eg: make omp_MCS_barrier or
			make mpi_MCS_barrier

4. To Run the barrier on PACE-ICE server:
   
  If you want to run all the test configurations for a barrier, please follow these steps:

	  1. Navigate to ~/DivyaKiran_Kadiyala_p2/<barrier_name> folder and launch ./run_<barrier_name>.pl
     	 This perl script would generate all the required .pbs scripts and launches them on the PACE-ICE cluster.
	 	 Once the runs are completed, it would generate a final CSV as well.

  But, if you want to run a specific barrier configuration, then please follow the below steps:

  	1. Navigate to ~/DivyaKiran_Kadiyala_p2/PBSscripts
  	2. Copy .pbs file into barrier folder which you would like to test (i.e. ~/DivyaKiran_Kadiyala_p2/<barrier_name>)
  	3. Run qsub <file_name>.pbs to submit job for scheduling on PACE-ICE server.
  	4. Run qstat for status of the submitted jobs.
  	5. Once job is complete it will generate *.out and *.csv file.
	6. open ".csv" file to view results.
